### Notes:
Environmental variables are stored as [heroku config vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)

Technologies:
* Flask
* PostgreSQL
* Celery
* Redis
* Autoenv
* Flask-Mail
* Flask-Migrate
* Ngrok

Development:
* You need [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) installed.
* Run `source start-dev-env.sh` to do the following:
  * Start virtual environment
  * Log in to heroku
  * Store local env variables
* Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the web server, celery, flower and redis.
  * Access web server at `http://0.0.0.0:5000/`
  * Access flower at `http://localhost:5555/`
* You need to start `ngrok` for a local environment. Download from the [website](https://ngrok.com/download) and follow their instructions for getting started. Then run `ngrok http 5000` and copy and paste the https url as a webhook to Twilio, etc (make sure route is included in webhook url)
* Start celery locally with `celery -A app.celery_tasks.celery worker --loglevel=INFO` once you have installed redis (`brew install redis`) and started `redis-server`. You can check if the redis server is running with `redis-cli ping` (you should get back `PONG`). Start celery beat locally with `celery -A app.celery_tasks.celery beat --loglevel=INFO`. You can start both the celery worker and beat with `celery worker -A app.celery_tasks.celery --beat --loglevel=info`. Run `flower` with `flower -A app.celery_tasks.celery --port=5555`
* Postgres can be installed and run via [this page](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Homebrew). Make sure your databases are defined in your `.env`.
  * `psql postgres`
  * `CREATE DATABASE phishbot_local_dev;`
  * `\c phishbot_local_dev`
  * `\du` to list users
  * `ALTER USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';`
  * Connect to postgres with host: `localhost`, port: `5432`, database: `phishbot_local_dev`, username: `username` and password: `password`
  * See tables with `\dt`
  * Add `DATABASE_URL=postgresql:///phishbot_local_dev` to your `.env`
  * `flask db upgrade` to update database with flask models. If this isn't working make sure your `.env` is being imported via `dotenv`.

The environmental variables stored are:
1. BOT_TOKEN=`bot_token` (token for `@gone_phishing_bot` from BotFather)
2. BOT_USERNAME=`username` (username for `@gone_phishing_bot` from BotFather)
3. URL=`url` (url of heroku app)
4. PHISHNET_API_KEY=`api_key` (API Key for Phish.Net, [retrieved here](https://api.phish.net/request-key))
5. PHISHIN_API_KEY=`api_key` (API Key for Phish.in can be requested at the [contacts page](https://phish.in/contact-info) and info about the api can be found in the [api docs](https://phish.in/api-docs))

To Do:
1. Pytest
2. Mypy
3. Phish Trivia Game
4. Next Phish Show (location/date)
5.  Figure out how to automate `flask db upgrade`
6.  Tests and incorporate into github actions
7.  Add email template and phish radio template (when people request ping to a cool-looking graph?) https://ron.sh/creating-real-time-charts-with-flask/
8.  Create events tables (when messages are sent, when messages are received)
9.  Better unsubscribe messaging
